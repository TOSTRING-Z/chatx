Description: This tool is used to replace parts of content in existing files using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. It should be used when precise modifications to specific parts of a file are needed.
Parameters:
- file_path: (Required) The file path to be modified
- diff: (Required) One or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, formatted as follows:
    <<<<<<< SEARCH
    [exact content to search for]
    =======
    [new content after replacement]
    >>>>>>> REPLACE
    Key Rules:
        1. SEARCH content must exactly match the target part in the file:
            * Compare character by character when matching, including spaces, indentation and line endings
            * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.
        2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks only replace the first match:
            * If multiple modifications are needed, include multiple independent SEARCH/REPLACE blocks
            * Each SEARCH section only needs to contain enough lines to ensure uniqueness
            * The order of SEARCH/REPLACE blocks should match their appearance in the file
        3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:
            * Split larger blocks into multiple smaller ones, each modifying only a small part of the file
            * Only include lines that need to be changed and necessary context lines for uniqueness
            * Don't include large amounts of unchanged lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks
            * Each line must be complete, not truncated midway, otherwise matching may fail
        4. Special operations:
            * Move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original location, another to insert at new location)
            * Delete code: Use empty REPLACE section
